# rmfakecloud


rmfakecloud is fake of the cloud sync the remarkable tablet is using, in case you want to sync/backup your files and have full control of the hosting/storage environment and don't trust Google.

# Status 
early prototype (sync and notifications work). no security and a lot of quick and dirty hacks.
currently only a single device is "supported" to work reliably i.e. clients not distingished due to the lack of auth

# Installation

## From source

Install and build the project:  
`go get -u github.com/ddvk/rmfakecloud`

run  
`~/go/bin/rmfakecloud`  


or clone an do: `go run .`  
or `make run`  
or `make all` artifacts are in the `dist` folder. the Arm binaries work on pi3 / Synology etc  
or `make docker && ./rundocker.sh`  


env variables:  
`PORT` port number (default: 3000)  
`DATADIR` to set data/files directory (default: data in current dir)  
`STORAGE_URL` the storage url resolvable from the device (default: http://hostname:port)  
`LOGLEVEL` default to **info** (set to **debug** for more logging or **warn**, **error** for less)

# Handwriting Recognition
In order to get hwr running with myScript register for a developer account and set the env variables: 

`RMAPI_HWR_APPLICATIONKEY`  
`RMAPI_HWR_HMAC`

# Sending emails
Define the following env variables:

```
RM_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com:465
RM_SMTP_USERNAME=user@domain.com
RM_SMTP_PASSWORD=plaintextpass  # Application password should work
```

If you want to provide custom FROM header for your mails, you can use:
```
RM_SMTP_FROM='"ReMarkable self-hosted" <user@domain.com>'
```

# Prerequisites / Device Modifications

## Without patching the binary
all needed artifacts are in `scripts/device/` folder
For Automatic script check [Automagic](scripts/device/readme.md)

Install a root CA on the device, you can use the `device/gencert.sh` script
- generate a CA and host certificate for *.appspot.com []()
- create the CA folder: `mkdir -p /usr/local/share/ca-certificates`
- copy the CA.crt file to `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` and run `update-ca-certificates`
- modify the hosts file `/etc/hosts`
	- so the options are:
        1. run a reverse https proxy on the rm tablet as a service, e.g. [secure](https://github.com/yi-jiayu/secure)
            - stop xochitl `systemctl stop xochitl`
            - add to /etc/hosts
                ```
                127.0.0.1 hwr-production-dot-remarkable-production.appspot.com
                127.0.0.1 service-manager-production-dot-remarkable-production.appspot.com
                127.0.0.1 local.appspot.com
                127.0.0.1 my.remarkable.com
                ```
            - set the address of your api host:port in the reverse proxy
                `secure -cert proxy.crt -key proxy.key http://host_where_the_api_is_running:3000`
                or use the provided systemd unit file and put the config in proxycfg

            - run the host
            - run `fixsync.sh` on the device to mark all files as new (not to be deleted from the device)
            - start xochitl `systemctl start xochitl`
		2. run the fakeapi on port 443 with a certificate signed by the CA you installed
        - modify the hosts files to point to this host
        3. install only the CA certificate on the device
        - modify your DNS Server/router to resolve the aforementioned addesses to a https reverse proxy
        - install the hosts certificate on the proxy and route to the api e.g:
            - on a ubiquity router /etc/dnsmasq.d/rm.conf
               address=/my.remarkable.com/192.168.0.10
               etc
            - on a synology there is an application portal which you can configure as a reverse proxy
        - ***CONS*** this will affect ALL devices, but you use the mobile apps and windows clients without modifications

# Caveats/ WARNING
- connecting to the api will delete all your files, unless you mark them as not synced `synced:false` prior to syncing

# TODO

- [ ] auth / authz
- [ ] multi tenant
- [ ] fix go stuff
- [ ] storage providers (dropbox, fs etc)
- [ ] db (fs, sqlite etc)
- [ ] liveview
- [ ] ui (react)
- [ ] ut
- [ ] ci/cd
- [ ] refactor


# How the cloud sync works or (will I lose my files) requested by @torwag
(my interpretation and flawed observations)

Given a new unregistered device, all the files that are generated locally have a status `synced:false`

Registration:

the device sends a post request to: `my.remarkable.com/token/json/2/device/new`
containing the random key (currently any key will be accepted) and gets a device token

with the device token it obtains expiring access tokens: `my.remarkable.com/token/json/2/user/new`

having a user access token: 

sends a request to the services locator to get the urls of additional services:
`/service/json/1/(web|mail|notification|storage)`(now always local.appspot.com)
it gets a list of all documents


Gets the list of documents from the server: `/document-storage/json/2/docs`
the order may be not correct at all:
- ***deletes*** all documents not in the list and having `synced: false`
- ***deletes*** all documents from the cloud that have `deleted: true`
- applies renames, page changes
- sends all new and marks them `synced: true`
- sends all modified documents (having a greater Version number?)
- it doesn't re-download any changed/newer documents


So if you just point the device to a new empty server, all documents will be deleted from the device. 
Going back will again, delete all documents and put what was on the server

# Troubleshooting
- check the connectivity between the tablet and the host:
    ping my.remarkable.com (should be localhost)
    ping local.remarkable.com (should be localhost)
    ping thehostpc
    wget -qO- http://host:3000 (or relevant ports, should get Working...)
    wget -qO- https://local.appspot.com (should get Working...)
    
- check that the proxy is running and certs are installed:
    ```
    echo Q | openssl s_client -connect localhost:443  -verify_hostname local.appspot.com 2>&1 | grep Verify
    ```
    You should see: *Verify return code: 0 (ok)*

- if both (host and tablet) are on a wifi make sure "Client Isolation" is not actived on the AP

- check if the proxy is configured correctly
    ```
    systemctl status proxy

    #or

    journalctl -u proxy
    ```
- check if the CA cert was correctly installed
    when doing `update-ca-certificates` there should have been `1 added`
    check the logs

- check xochitls's logs, stop the service, start manually with more logging
    ```
    systemctl stop xochitl
    QT_LOGGING_RULES=xochitl.*=true xochitl | grep -A3 QUrl

    ```
    if you see *SSL Handshake failed* then something is wrong with the certs
